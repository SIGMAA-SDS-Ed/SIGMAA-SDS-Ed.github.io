## SIGMAA on Statistics and Data Science Education

### Article I. Identification

#### Section 1. Name

The name of the SIGMAA will be the SIGMAA on Statistics and Data Science Education.

#### Section 2. Purpose

The purpose of this SIGMAA is to:

1. facilitate the exchange of ideas through meetings, sessions, publications, and electronic media, about:
  - a) teaching statistics and data science, from introductory service courses through advanced undergraduate courses,
  - b) the undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum and its role within programs of mathematical sciences,
  - c) all other issues related to providing students with effective and engaging encounters with statistics and data science in their courses of study;
2. foster increased understanding of statistics and data science among members of the MAA and among broader constituencies, for example by encouraging the publication of expository articles and statistical and data science theory and practice;
3. promote the discipline of statistics and data science among students;
4. work cooperatively with other organizations to encourage effective teaching and learning of statistics and data science.

### Article II. Activities

#### Section 1. Section Activities

This SIGMAA will engage in activities such as, but not limited to, the following:

1. Hold an annual meeting in conjunction with MathFest,
2. Sponsor sessions in connection with MathFest,
3. Maintain an e-mail list to facilitate communication among members,
4. Maintain a web page of links related to undergraduate statistics and data science,
5. Promote the publication of articles related to undergraduate statistics and data science in MAA publications, and
6. Encourage similar activities among (regional) sections of the MAA.

#### Section 2. Relationship with MAA Activities

1. The ASA/MAA Joint Committee on Undergraduate Statistics and Data Science Education. Opportunities for cooperation between the SIGMAA and the Committee abound. While the Committee's charge is to address issues of curriculum, pedagogy, and faculty development, the SIGMAA will provide a group that can work at a more "grass roots" level to implement various initiatives. It is also expected that the SIGMAA will provide a means of communicating needs and concerns for the Committee's consideration. To facilitate this communication in both directions, it is expected that MAA representatives will join the SIGMAA and that SIGMAA officers will attend the meetings of the Committee. This SIGMAA will also aim to contribute to the work of other MAA committees whose charges concern statistics education. Examples include the Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics and the Committee on Professional Development. This SIGMAA will also seek to work closely with the analogous group within the American Statistical Association - its Section on Statistics and Data Science Education, and with similar groups committed to statistics education within other organizations.
2. No activity of this SIGMAA, including publications, shall be represented as coming from the MAA at large, but rather from this SIGMAA, unless such activity and representation have been approved by the Executive Committee of the MAA. c. Reports of this SIGMAA's activities shall be included in an annual report submitted by the SIGMAA to the MAA Committee on SIGMAAs, with copies to the chair of the Coordinating Council to which the SIGMAA is assigned.

### Article III. Meetings

#### Section 1. Frequency and place of meetings

The general membership meeting of this SIGMAA shall take place at the August MAA MathFest. Other activities may be scheduled at the summer MAA meeting and at MAA Section meetings. SIGMAA business may also be conducted by e-mail provided that a quorum is attained.

#### Section 2. Conduct of meetings

The SIGMAA Chair shall preside over the annual business meeting. The Chair will circulate an agenda via e-mail one month in advance and will ask for additional agenda items at that time. The Chair will allow ample time for discussion and will seek to achieve consensus. When a consensus is not reached, decisions will be made by a vote using Robert's Rules of Order. When the Executive Committee decides that an issue requires attention of the entire SIGMAA before the next general meetings, it may conduct a business meeting over e-mail. The same definition of a quorum applies to any vote taken over e-mail, and again it is expected that ample time for discussion will be allowed. Members will be given at least two weeks to vote on any issue requiring a vote over e-mail.
- **Section 3**. A quorum at membership meetings, including e-mail meetings, shall consist of at least 20 members and at least three officers. At least two of the three officers must be elected, as opposed to appointed officers.

### Article IV. Membership
