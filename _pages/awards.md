## Robert V. Hogg Award for Excellence in Teaching Introductory Statistics

This award provides recognition to an individual who has been teaching introductory statistics at the college level for between three (3) and fifteen (15) years, and who has shown both excellence and growth in teaching during that time. It is named in honor of Robert V. Hogg, winner of numerous teaching accolades including the Iowa Governor’s Science Medal for Teaching in 1990 and the MAA’s Distinguished Teaching award in 1993. Hogg was also a passionate advocate for statistics education who served as the President of the American Statistical Association in 1988.

The award is given yearly at the SIGMAA Stat Ed business meeting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings from the nominations received the previous year.
