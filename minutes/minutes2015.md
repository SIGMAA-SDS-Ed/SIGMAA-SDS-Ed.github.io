- PRIMUS Proposal - Randy
  - Randy introduced Matthew Boelkins  (PRIMUS Editor) who is considering a special edition of PRIMUS on Statistic Education

    - Need: Authors, Guest Editors, and Referees if they do a special issue
    - Process: Proposal Form and Materials available for the special issue

  - Randy asked about the timeline, Matt responded
