# SIGMAA Statistics Education Business Meeting Minutes

January 7, 2012

- Welcome -- Brian Gill, chair
  - Introduction of new officers: Scott Alberts, chair-elect; Andy Zieffler, chair-elect moving to chair at the end of the meeting; Kim Roth, treasurer.
  - Thanks to old officers: Nancy Boynton, past chair; Lisa Carnell, secretary (continuing); Sue Schou, treasurer; Todd Iverson, webmaster (continuing).
  - Attendees introduced themselves. There were 43 attendees present at the meeting.
- Secretary's Report -- Lisa Carnell
  - Minutes from last year's meeting were distributed and approved by the members.
- Treasurer's Report -- Sue Schou
  - The treasurer's report was the same as the one given in 2011 because of a lack of information from MAA about budgets and spending.
- Discussion -- Brian Gill
  - The Dex Whittinghill Award for Best Statistics Education Contributed Paper at JMM 2011 was awarded to Daniel Kaplan for his talk "Confounding the Traditional Introductory Statistics Course".
  - It was announced that the Alder Award for 2012 was presented to Michael Posner.
  - Attendees were reminded of the SIGMAA on Statistics Education contributed paper sessions for the 2012 JMM:
    - Innovations in Teaching Statistics in the New Decade I
    - Motivating Statistical and Quantitative Learning Through Social Engagement
    - Innovations in Teaching Statistics in the New Decade II
- Future Meetings
  - JMM 2013 -- San Diego
    - Proposed CPS: Adding Modern Ideas to an Introductory Statistics Course
    - Minicourses: Using Randomization Methods to Build Conceptual Understanding of Statistical Inference; Teaching Introductory Statistics (for instructors new to teaching introductory statistics).
    - Suggested ideas for panels (due in April):
      - Using randomization/bootstrap methods in an introductory statistics course
      - Examining the role of probability and statistics in the common core standards
      - What is being done to train teachers to teach probability and statistics in the common core? How can SIGMAA Stat-Ed be involved?
      - What would you do with all this data? Large data sets in intro courses.
      - How to implement change in statistics courses?
      - Implementing a minor or concentration in statistics for non-calculus based majors (i.e. psychology)
      - New ways to assess as the curriculum in statistics changes
      - What are we teaching in statistics now and in the future?
      - What courses should we offer after the first course for non-calculus students?
      - Update on the state of the common core standards, especially training teachers for the common core curriculum
      - Teaching health statistics
      - How do colleagues in other departments teach statistics?
      - Assessment in the common core for probability and statistics
- Discussion
  - Should SIGMAA Stat-Ed have a position paper on assessment in statistics in the common core? It may be better to come up with a statement to send to the common core designers offering to give feedback on the assessments.
  - Look at Park and Smarter Balance websites to see statistics problems from the common core and give feedback.
  - CUPM -- Patti Frazer Lock
    - CUPM is soliciting input for the next edition of the MAA Curriculum Guide. Patti Frazer Lock is chair of the subcommittee on introductory statistics courses for math majors. Sample syllabi for this course are being solicited.
  - There is a new NSF proposal from CAUSE, CAUSE and EFFECTS. Our SIGMAA has been asked to write a letter of support for this proposal.
  - eCOTS 2012: The First Biennial Electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics, May 14-18, 2012 [http://www.causeweb.org/ecots](http://www.causeweb.org/ecots)
  - A motion was approved in principle to begin giving the Robert V. Hogg Award for Excellence in Teaching Introductory Statistics. Two modifications to the original proposal were made, (1) the award may not be given every year, and (2) adjust the language about what comes with the award with the prize to be determined by the executive committee.
  - The finances of the SIGMAA were discussed. The significant balance which had accrued on paper over the years is now gone. In the future, MAA will allocate a certain amount of money to the SIGMAA. Requests can be made for additional funds, but they may not be granted. A motion was approved to have someone from the SIGMAA attend the MAA business meeting on Saturday and express concern about the change in the way SIGMAAs are funded.
  - Door prizes were awarded, and the meeting was adjourned.

Minutes submitted by Lisa Carnell, secretary.
