## Welcome

The purpose of this SIGMAA is to facilitate the exchange of ideas about teaching statistics and data science, the undergraduate statistics and data science curricula and all other issues related to providing students with effective and engaging encounters with these topics in their courses of study.  We also hope to foster increased understanding of statistics and data science among members of the MAA, promote the discipline of statistics and data science among students, and work cooperatively with other organizations to encourage effective teaching and learning of statistics and data science.

The SIGMAA SDS-Ed awards the Robert V. Hogg Award and the Dexter C. Whittinghill III Award at the SIGMAA business meeting at MathFest annually.

## News

We will be holding elections for Chair-Elect (1 year) and Secretary-Treasurer (2 years, elected in even years) in the Fall 2023 â€“ please consider running for office or nominating a colleague. New terms begin January 1.

## Nominations Open for the Robert V. Hogg Award for Excellence in Teaching Introductory Statistics

The Hogg Award provides recognition to an individual who has shown both excellence and growth in teaching introductory statistics at the college level. This award is presented annually at MathFest. Nomination packets should be submitted to Nick Gorgievski, Chair of the Award Committee, at [Nick.Gorgievski@nichols.edu](mailto:Nick.Gorgievski@nichols.edu).
