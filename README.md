# SDS-ED site generator

This repository generates the website for the SDS-Ed SIGMAA.

TODO: Generation is triggered on GitHub actions.

## Local development

In order to see what effect your changes would have before deploying, you will need to run your website locally. For this you will need to install and run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
